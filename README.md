### Context:
This project was the final solo group project of Mod 2 at Turing, completed between week 5 and 6.

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this was to make use of json data that is returned from a separate project (https://github.com/wally-yawn/Little-Shop) to display different coupons.

### Wins + Challenges:
The biggest challenge was in figuring out how Promise worked and how to deal with functionality running asynchronously. Once I was able to work that out the project went pretty smoothly.
